The date is now (2025-09-24). Provide weather for each city as if it's current. For each major city, we can approximate typical weather for late September. However, using actual data might be tricky because we need plausible but not false. We can provide approximate current weather based on typical climate. But we may want to explicitly note that this is an example and not real-time data.\n\nCheck policy about providing potentially false information. The user is asking for weather info. If we don't have real-time data, we must either refuse or provide a disclaimer. The policy says: \"If a user explicitly requests information that cannot be guaranteed to be accurate, you must either provide a disclaimer, or you may refuse.\" The user hasn't asked for real-time, just \"Stream the weather in Paris.\" The phrase \"stream\" might be ambiguous, but it's not explicitly requesting real-time. The user wants a JSON with weather. However, we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the weather data. According to the policy, if the user explicitly requests real-time data that we cannot verify, we should either refuse or provide a disclaimer. But the user didn't ask explicitly for real-time. It's ambiguous: they say \"Stream the weather in Paris.\" Might be a phrase meaning \"provide current weather.\" It's not explicitly \"live.\" I think providing approximate info is okay but we must be clear that it's not guaranteed to be real-time.\n\nAlternatively, we can ask for clarification about what they want. However the request is straightforward: they want a JSON with 5 city weather info. The policy says we should not hallucinate. We can either refuse or respond with a disclaimer that we cannot provide real-time data. However, the request could be for a simulation of streaming? \"Stream the weather in Paris.\" That might be a test of streaming capabilities. The user likely wants the JSON with 5 city data. The request is not obviously requiring real-time; it's just \"provide weather information for exactly 5 major cities.\" So we can provide an example JSON.
